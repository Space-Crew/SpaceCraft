# SpaceCraft

SpaceCraft is an in-browser, multiplayer block building game, inspired by Lego and Minecraft, where players can build anything out of the 'block' in a 3D environment. Users can construct an entire world however they wish, share their creations, and invite their friends to collaborate in the same world. In addition, users can explore the myriad of existing worlds which include flowing water tiles, 3D mazes and amazing artworks. The game controls are mainly built with Three.js and React while multiplayer functionalities are supported by firebase, which is used as the back end.
